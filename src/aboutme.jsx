            I've worked as a plumber & welder for seven years and I've learned a lot when it comes to working in
            teams, team leading and plan big operations. My future looked very bright in constructions but I turned it down and 
            started to follow my passion instead, CODING!
            Then maybe you ask yourself - If coding is my passion, why didnt I choose that career path insted?
            </p>
            <p>Because it wasn't a option for me when I was fifteen and choosing my highschool, I didnt even know it existed.
                I even hade to move 260km when I was fifteen to become a plumber. 
                But I did good - But now its time to do better.
            </p>
